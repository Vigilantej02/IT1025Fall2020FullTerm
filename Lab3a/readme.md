# Executive Summary
In this lab, I attempt to explain the roles of application, utility, operating system and ERP software. I also Explain the purpose of virtualization and the
difference between virtualization and cloud computing.
# Software 
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each. 
1. Operating System software manages the interface between hardware and the user. An example of this is Windows.
2. Application software perform specific tasks. These are software like Steam and Discord.
3. Utility software is software that allows you to modify or change your PC. These are programs like Malware Bytes and any Uninstall Wizard.
* ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software is used to centralize a set of data to be used by an entire organization. An example of this is, say a business has a customer
list that its customer support team uses. That list would be different than the list the sales team uses, because only people with problems call
customer support.

# Virtualization

* explain the purpose of virtualization. 
* The purpose of virtualization is to free up resources for servers. By splitting one server into two, you end up benefitting.

#### Explain the following: 
* Virtualization is used to run legacy applications from different vendors. Say you were running a Windows application as a security measure but also needed to 
use a MacOs application for your work. Virtualization allows you to do both of these.
* Hypervisors are simply the partitions seperating the physical components from their virtual enviroments.
#### Cloud computing vs. Virtualization: 

* While Virtualization is the actual technology that allows resources to be divided up between physical components, Cloud computing is the enviroment in which it takes place.

* Explain how a network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing?
An administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing by pooling together the resources from virtualization and allowing its content to be shared through
an intranet or internet.
 
# Conclusion
* In conclusion, Virtualization is good at freeing up resources from physical components, Hypervisors are the partitions used to do that, and Cloud Computing is what happens
when you allow the resources from virtualization onto a network or the internet.
