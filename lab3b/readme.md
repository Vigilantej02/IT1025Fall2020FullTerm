## Industry Certification
* CompTIA is a cybersecurity certification to show you are adept at analytics based security.

## College Certificates
* Out of the certificates offered at Tri-C I will probably go after the post-degree certificate for programming and development.
* In order to become co-op ready a student must: be enrolled full time at Tri-C, have taken atleast 12 credit hours AND atleast a 2.75 GPA. The benefits of doing an internship/co-op is that you get actual hands-on experience you can put on future resumes.

## Professional Membership
* One of the organziations I'm interested in is NCCDC because I am interested in the security side of things. The benefits would be getting hands-on experience.

# Conclusion
The purpose of this weeks lab was to learn more about certifcations, what career we're exactly getting ourselves into and how internships can help with getting a job.
